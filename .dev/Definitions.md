## Lore
Stories that feel kept, not consumed.

### Scope & Categories

    World-Building: Invented places, maps, future histories, and cultural fragments.

    Short Stories: Standalone narratives that hint at larger realities.

    Creative Writing: Fictional documents, journals, letters, and biographies.

    Poems: Texts that feel discovered or archival rather than performed.

    Micro-Lore: Unfinished myths, stray ideas, and fragments. Completion is not required; presence is.

    Micro-Lore: Unfinished myths, stray ideas, and fragments. Completion is not required; presence is.

    Elements: Living nodes of lore (Characters, Environments, Objects). Unlike static stories, Elements are containers that accumulate history. They utilize subcollections to house events, backstories, and evolution over time.

### Core Philosophy

    Lore vs. Content: Lore implies rather than explains. It is anti-performance and designed to be returned to, unlike content which demands immediate reaction.

    Structure: A library of distinct, parallel worlds, not a single shared canon. The library is the unifying frame.

    Evolution: Items are living documents. Through versioning, drafts remain accessible while stories expand and gain context over time.

Definition

"Lore is what stories become when they’re allowed to stay."
